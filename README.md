# Flight-Price-Analysis-Project
Hereâ€™s an updated description for your project on GitHub, reflecting the two completed analyses:



## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight prices from a dataset obtained from Goibibo, with two primary analyses: **Best Time to Fly (Price vs. Time Analysis)** and **Airline Comparison and Performance Analysis**. The goal of these analyses is to provide insights into how flight prices vary based on time and airline performance, helping users make informed decisions when booking flights.

### 1. Best Time to Fly (Price vs. Time Analysis)
**Objective**: Identify the best time to book flights for the lowest prices by analyzing historical data.
- Grouped flight data by different time periods (month, day of the week) to understand price variations.
- Analyzed the impact of **departure** and **arrival times** on flight prices to determine if flights at certain times of the day are generally cheaper or more expensive.

### 2. Airline Comparison and Performance Analysis
**Objective**: Compare different airlines based on pricing, flight duration, and number of stops to determine which airline offers the best value.
- Compared multiple airlines on factors like price, duration, and stops to find the best value-for-money airline options.
- Conducted performance analysis based on pricing trends across different airlines.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing trends and patterns.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for executing and documenting the analysis.
